                <p>An idea in the text that made me think was that robots have the ability to think and learn about humans. They have a third-person view to understand humans, which they saw hilarious. Humans are arrogant about everything, sad because it's human destiny. As a human being, I can see that's unquestionable.

                <h2>Text-to-Text</h2>
                <p>There are many interesting world ending movies, the whole purpose of this type of movie is to warn humans. The view from this story is that three robots travel the wreckage of New York city. Others of the same type of story usually have views from humans, but “Three Robot” chooses to use the view from god, which is the three robots viewing and commenting about humans. Usually in these movies, humans have a good ending, they always have a main character to save the world, but in this world, humans have already ended. In real life, humans don’t have a main character to save the world, all we can do is to protect the environment.

                <h2>Text-to-World</h2>
                <p>This text made me think that human civilization has lots of problems, whether they are from before or now. Human civilization can really be wiped out in a day. The three robots are like the alien that watches us every day, the alien that just watches us silently. The world from the anime seems like humans have just been wiped out by their own hand, but they leave some traces such as the city building, and other products by humans. Humans are so arrogant and that makes them destroyed by themselves, the robot says. We can see that humans from now on don't really care about the natural environment, we use all the resources from Earth. Humans think they are the top predator on earth, which make them arrogant. </p>
