                <h2>The Story of Three Robot</h2>
                <p>Long after the fall of humanity, three robots (<a href="wiki.html">K-VRC, XBOT 4000, and 11-45-G</a>) wander through a post-apocalyptic city,
                trying to understand how humans lived based on their limited knowledge of them and the things they left behind. 
                They learn the concept of human sports, consumption, and eventually pets when they encounter a living cat, 
                which proceeds to follow them. The three robots learn about their origins and later arrive at what appears to be a nuclear missile base. 
                <a href="wiki.html">11-45-G</a> explains that humans died out from environmental disasters caused by their own actions. 
                <a href="wiki.html">K-VRC</a> states that at one point, humans genetically engineered their cats, giving them intelligence. 
                The cat then proves this by showing it can speak, demanding to be petted, while many other cats in the base corner the three robots.</p>
